<span style="font-size:27px;"> **üöó The Question:**<span>

How do commute distance, employee location, and weekday patterns impact driving frequency? Can we model this behavior effectively?

<span style="font-size:27px;"> **üîç Exploring the Data:**<span>

A one-month dataset of 1,154 employees' parking swipe records was analyzed. Each commute day (when an employee used their parking card) was tracked by zip code, distance, and day of the week.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

<span style="font-size:27px;"> **üìä Modeling to predict commute frequency:** <span>

To predict commute frequency, several models were tested:

ü§î **Linear Regression** - Since observations from the same ID are likely to be more similar to each other than observations from different IDs, independence assumption is simply violated.<br>
ü§î **Mixed-Effects Models** ‚Äì Consider this model: 
`tdrive = day + (1|id)` (ID is now considered a grouping factor)

        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/const_var.png" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" style="height: 150px; object-fit: contain;" %}
    </div>
</div>

</div>
Count data often exhibit a mean-variance relationship, where the variance increases as the mean increases.This can lead to non-constant variance.

üòé Generalized Linear Mixed Model ‚Äì Since `total drives` represents count data, both Poisson and Binomial models are potential choices. However, Poisson assumes that the mean and variance are equal, which is often unrealistic in real-world datasets due to overdispersion. Additionally, `total drives to office` has an upper bound (the total possible commute days in a month per employee), making a Binomial model more appropriate than a Poisson model.
Below is the Model Comparision chart:

<th>Model Formula (R Code)</th>
<th>Degrees of Freedom</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Linear Regression</td>
<td>tdrive~as.factor(day)+ as.factor(id)</td>
<td>1161</td>
<td>33750.41</td>

<br>

The BIC for Binomial Model is the lowest and hence, this is the best fit model amongst the others.

The residuals still show some heteroscedasticity, but the variance pattern is less structured compared to the Linear Mixed Effect Model.
While the assumption of constant variance is still not perfectly met, this model provides a better fit than the others.

<span style="font-size:27px;"> **‚úÖ Key Takeaways:**<span>

üöÄ Commute behavior varies widely, with some employees driving more frequently than others, even at similar distances.<br>
üöÄ A Binomial Mixed-Effects Model best predicts commute frequency, outperforming Linear and Poisson models by accounting for individual variability and bounded commute counts.<br>
üöÄ Findings can help optimize parking allocation and inform flexible work policies to reduce peak-hour congestion.
