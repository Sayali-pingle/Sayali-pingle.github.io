Welcome! I am a graduate student at <span class="highlight-word">Duke University</span>, pursuing a Master's in <span class="highlight-word">Statistical Science</span>. With a strong foundation in statistics and proficient programming skills, I specialize in building scalable, data-driven applications that drive meaningful business impact.

I have worked as a <span class="highlight-word">Data Scientist</span> for two years, gaining deep industry experience in understanding business needs and delivering high-value solutions. I strongly believe in the power of simplicity—"Simple models are often better than complex ones"—while knowing when complexity is necessary to unlock deeper insights.

Currently, I am deeply fascinated by the rapidly evolving field of <span class="highlight-word">Generative AI</span>. I am actively building <span class="highlight-word">agentic RAG pipelines</span> with Deepseek and LangGraph, continuously staying updated with the latest advancements in AI and machine learning.

I am seeking full-time opportunities where I can apply my expertise to exciting projects and collaborate with innovative teams. If my work aligns with your interests, I'd love to connect!

Beyond analytics, I am a novice artist with a passion for sketching and acrylic painting. My creative side helps me craft aesthetic data visualizations and dashboards, blending art with analytics to tell compelling data stories.
