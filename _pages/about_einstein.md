Welcome! I am a graduate student at Duke University, pursuing a Master's in Statistical Science. With a strong foundation in statistics and proficient programming skills, I specialize in building scalable, data-driven applications that drive meaningful business impact.

I have worked as a Data Scientist for two years, gaining deep industry experience in understanding business needs and delivering high-value solutions. I strongly believe in the power of simplicity—"Simple models are often better than complex ones"—while knowing when complexity is necessary to unlock deeper insights.

Currently, I am deeply fascinated by the rapidly evolving field of Generative AI. I am actively building agentic RAG pipelines with Deepseek and LangGraph, continuously staying updated with the latest advancements in AI and machine learning.

I am seeking full-time opportunities where I can apply my expertise to exciting projects and collaborate with innovative teams. If my work aligns with your interests, I’d love to connect!

Beyond analytics, I am a novice artist with a passion for sketching and acrylic painting. My creative side helps me craft aesthetic data visualizations and dashboards, blending art with analytics to tell compelling data stories.

Let’s connect and explore opportunities together!
